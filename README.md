# MIPS
An instruction level MIPS simulator written in Java.
This program simulates a MIPS processor with a limited instruction set and without pipelining.

# Usage
> Must have java 16 installed.
> Open commandline, cd to /MIPS/out/production
> Then enter: java io.github.stevenlaczko.Main

In the bottom of the directory you will find input and output folders.
Place an instructions file (one byte per line) in the input folder called Instructions.txt
Place a memory init file in the same folder called IMemory.txt

Alternatively, run any instructions file in the input folder by typing "run X" where X is the filename once CLI shows up.

Output memory and register files will appear in the output folder.

Thanks!
